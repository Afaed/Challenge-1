      <h1>American Society For Velociraptor Attack Prevention</h1>
      <p>
      Velociraptor attack is the 3rd leading cause of death for men age 27-29. However, everyone must think about the implications of velociraptors: young and old, men, women and transgendered persons.
      </p>
      <p>The American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention is a bi-partisan group of professionals, dedicated to the diffusion of knowledge concerning velociraptor attack prevention.

      <h2> Know the Enemy</h2>

              The velociraptor
          </a> 
          is a bipedal carnivore with a long, stiffened tail and can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout. It has a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, up to 67 millimeters (2.6 in) long around its outer edge, is a predatory device, used to tear into the prey, delivering a fatal blow. 
          Velociraptors are commonly found on tropical islands, converted to millionaire amusement parks, but are commonly being sighted in the Pacific Northwest.

      <h2>Essential facts ypu should know about velociraptors</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Velociraptors hunt in packs, and are known to form an equilateral triangle around its prey.
          </li>
          <li>
              Velociraptors can accelerate 4 m/s2, with a top speed of 25 m/s on open terrain, 10 m/s while wounded, and 10 m/s in indoor laboratories. 
          </li>
          <li>
              Velociraptors can open doors, but are slowed by them. They can open an initial door in approximately 5 minutes, and will take half that time for each subsequent door.

      <h2>New Home Buyer Tips</h2>
      <p>
          When buying a new home, there are a few things to look out for when assessing potential velociraptor attacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Check all doors and windows. Doors should be made of solid oak or steel. Windows should have steel bars with spacing smaller than the average raptor. 
          </li>
          <li>
              Make sure all entryways have adequate deadbolts.
